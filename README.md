# Bunny Haven

The primary goal of this website is to find a new home for rabbits that have been abandoned, rabbits that have been rescued, and rabbits that need to be rehomed.

Creating an informative, clear, and easy to navigate website will suppport the primary goal.

### Manual Testing

- Tested carousel on the Homepage. Autoplay is working. The previous/next controls and indicators are all working correctly.

- Tested responsiveness across different screen sizes and noriced that there were some alignment issues on the "Adopt a bunny" section. 
*Fixed this issue by targeting the carousel-adopt id in the media queries.*

- *Added fixed-top class to the navbar on all pages to improve the user experience.*

- Tested the links on the navbar. This showed that when pressing the Rehome link, the fixed navbar is hiding the "Rehome a bunny" section. 
*Fixed this by adding padding-top to .section style on CSS.*

- On smaller screens, clicking on the burger icon opens the dropdown, but hides the page content.
*Used the Javascript code provided for the Boardwalk Games project, to close the navbar once the user has clicked the link.*

- Testing the Adopt page showed that the cards in the "Meet the bunnies" page are not centered on smaller screen. This issue is yet to be fixed.
